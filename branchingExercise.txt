1. git branch name_of_branch OR git checkout -b name_of-Branch (plus automatically switches to it)
2. fast forward vs. recursive (fast forward means all changes are on branches, nothing on previous branches while new changes being made)
3. git checkout
4. git branch -d name_of_branch
5. merge conflicts happen when the same code is changed on multiple branches at the same time
